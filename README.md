# ilmatieteenlaitosAvoinData
This is a small software development project intended to create a simple piece of software with a GUI that could be used to select a weather station (or stations) and to save data from them over a selected time period into a CSV file.

This is to be done using the several open data APIs including the Finnish Meterological Institute.

Should this project ever be finished, it will be published under the MIT License.

The API used publishes data under the Creative Commons license.
